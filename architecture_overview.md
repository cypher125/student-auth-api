## Key Design Decisions

### Facial Recognition Architecture

The system implements a multi-stage facial recognition pipeline:

1. **Face Detection**: Using MTCNN to detect and crop faces from images
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using InsightFace to generate face embeddings
3. **Similarity Matching**: Comparing embeddings against stored templates
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Determining match probability with a configurable threshold

### Authentication System

JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication was selected for:

* **Stateless Authentication**: No need to store session data
* **Mobile Friendliness**: Works well with mobile clients
* **Performance**: Minimal database queries for authentication
* **Refresh Mechanism**: Support for token refresh without re-login

### Database Schema Design

The database design follows these principles:

1. **Separation of User and Profile**: Clean separation between authentication and profile data
2. **UUID Primary Keys**: For improved security and distribution
3. **Audit Trails**: Tracking of all recognition attempts
4. **Image Storage**: Efficient storage of face images for verification and audit

### API Design Principles

1. **RESTful Structure**
   * Resources are represented as URLs
   * HTTP methods match CRUD operations
   * Proper status codes for responses
   * Consistent error formats

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   * JWT for authentication
   * Permission-based access control
   * Token refresh mechanism
   * Secure endpoints with proper permissions

3. **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation**
   * Interactive API documentation
   * Request/response schema documentation
   * Authentication flow documentation

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture Capacity

* Supports hundreds of concurrent users
* Handles thousands of recognition attempts per day
* Response time < 1s for recognition operations

### Future Scaling Strategies

1. **Database Scaling**
   * Migration to PostgreSQL for larger deployments
   * Database connection pooling
   * Read replicas for reporting queries

2. **API Scaling**
   * Horizontal scaling with multiple API instances
   * Load balancing across instances
   * Caching frequently accessed data

3. **Face Recognition Optimizations**
   * GPU acceleration for face recognition
   * Optimized model selection
   * Batch processing for enrollment

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication Security**
   * Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
   * Refresh token mechanism
   * Role-based access control
   * HTTPS for all communications

2. **Data Protection**
   * Face image encryption in transit
   * Secure media storage
   * Input validation and sanitization
   * Protection against common attacks (CSRF, XSS)

3. **Facial Recognition Security**
   * Liveness detection (future implementation)
   * Confidence thresholds to prevent false positives
   * Audit logging of all recognition attempts
   * Face image storage security
